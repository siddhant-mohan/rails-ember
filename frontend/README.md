Brunch Skeleton for Ember with Foundation
=========================================

This is a basic skeleton which shall get you up and running with ember. 
It uses foundation framework(http://foundation.zurb.com/) and font-awesome for
icon support. 
Support for updating ember via command line would be coming soon.
